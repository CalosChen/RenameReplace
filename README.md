# RenameReplace
RenameStringInFolderNameAndFileNameFileContent
This project's functionality is similar to a template engine, when we are having a project template with a unique name, we may want to create a new project based on this, which has similar structure, but with different names in both folders and files as well as contents, a live example is, we want to create a vs project, we have already had a project with a certain name, now we need to change the project name, as well as all namespaces or references, then this can be useful, simply input the root folder path, as well as inputstring and replacement, this program will search recursively in the folder and all its subfolders and files and replace the string. Looks like Linux command sed -i 's/old/new/g' |grep "new ./" functions similar, but needs rename command to recursively change file or folder names, this one is based on dotnet core.
